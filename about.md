title: About Me

Hey, I'm Peterâ€”coder by day, designer by night, and a tech enthusiast all the time. My journey into the digital world started young, at the ripe age of 11, with Batch scripts as my first language. It was like learning to cast spells, and I've been hooked on coding ever since.

Fast forward to today, I've got CS50's Introduction to Computer Science and CS50's Web Programming under my belt. These courses weren't just classes; they were adventures that took my skills to new heights. And now, I'm diving headfirst into the world of graphic design and UI/UX, blending logic with art to create digital experiences that feel good and work well.

This blog is where I share my passion for building safe, high-performance websites and applications. It's also a canvas for my design work, where functionality meets flair. So whether you're here to talk code, chat design, or just see what I'm up to, welcome to my world. Let's make something awesome together.
